Sources for the talk "WebAssembly Component Model" slides talks.

The slides are built in the [`../webassembly-component-model`](../webassembly-component-model) folder.

They are NOT built on the CI, but on the local machine, to avoid any surprise in the future about the build process (those are one shot slides, no need to build them on the CI).

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

## Run

```bash
npm run dev
```
